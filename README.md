Headless Binary Ninja (sort of!)

_Note_: A Snippet version can be copy/pasted from [here](https://gist.github.com/hugsy/714e0038d5d0b1deb7fad1907928252f)

## Description

This plugin allows you to use Binary Ninja headlessly and remotely to script and control Binja remotely without the need of an entreprise license. This makes it convenient for creating scripts, or live reversing using Jupyter for instance. It works internally by simply creating an RPyc service within the Python environment, and expose it on a TCP socket. Note that this plugin is Binary Ninja specific: an equivalent for IDA was created in the repository [IDA-Headless](https://github.com/hugsy/ida-headless).

**Important note**: this plugin exposes entirely the targeted Python VM over a TCP socket, in cleartext without authentication. Therefore *anyone* able to connect to it will be able to execute command on the remote system; so this plugin should never be used on a host that receive untrusted connections.

This plugin requires the installation of the [`rpyc`](https://rpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest) package, but the service is only opened on demand. It was tested and works well under Windows and Linux but is expected to work the same on MacOS.

## Installation

Install the files in the Binary Ninja plugin directory:

### Linux

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hugsy/binja-headless "$HOME/.binaryninja/plugins/binja-headless"
```

### macOS

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hugsy/binja-headless "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Binary Ninja/plugins/binja-headless"
```

### Windows

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hugsy/binja-headless "$env:AppData/Binary Ninja/plugins/binja-headless"
```

Then start Binary Ninja and check in the logs the plugin is correctly loaded.
```text
Loaded python3 plugin 'binja-headless'
```

## Settings

Settings can be configured to specify a different host and port (default `0.0.0.0:18812`) to listen to by RPyC.
You can also enable the plugin autostart, allowing it to launch immediately in background when Binary Ninja starts.

## Requirements

Make sure `rpyc` is installed in Binary Ninja: Palette -> `Install python3 module` and enter `rpyc` with the version as mentioned in the `requirements.txt`  file, in the dialog box that appeared.

After a few seconds, the following message should appear in the log

```text
[Default] Running pip ['C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Vector35\\BinaryNinja\\plugins\\python\\python.exe', '-m', 'pip', '--isolated', '--disable-pip-version-check', 'install', '--upgrade', '--upgrade-strategy', 'only-if-needed', '--target', 'C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Binary Ninja\\python310\\site-packages', 'rpyc>=6.0.0']
[Default] Successfully installed dependencies.
```

You can now use Binja-RPyC !

## Start / Stop the service manually

You can now start the service (Palette -> `Binja-RPyc - Start RPyc Service`). A popup will confirm the service is running, or show the error in the logs on failure.

## Usage

From a remote Python terminal, you can now import the `rpyc` module and access your remote Binary Ninja.

```python
>>> import rpyc
>>> c = rpyc.connect("192.168.57.2", 18812)
>>> bn = c.root.binaryninja
```

If the service was started manually with the GUI, a binaryview is automatically exposed (as `bv`) in the `root` namespace.

```python
>>> c.root.bv
<BinaryView: '//DESKTOP-SD4TH5/Temp/ls', len 0x248e8>

>>> dir(c.root.binaryninja)
['ActionType',
 'ActiveAnalysisInfo',
 'AddressField',
 'AddressRange',
 'AdvancedFunctionAnalysisDataRequestor',
 'AnalysisCompletionEvent',
 [...]
```

And then you can create some aliases to make as if you were using it locally:

```python
>>> bv = c.root.bv
```

If the service was started automatically, no binary view is attached, but it can be opened using normal binja API calls:

```python
# Load a binary
>>> bv = bn.load("/path/to/my/bin")
# Load a BNDB
>>> bv = bn.load("/path/to/file.bndb")

>>> assert isinstance(bv, bn.binaryview.BinaryView)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Before 3.5.4378 you must use `binaryninja.open_view()` to open BNDB files

> [!WARNING]
> By opening a BNDB file analyzed with a prior version of binja will display an error popup, and throw an `Exception`
> See the [binary ninja documentation](https://api.binary.ninja/index.html#binaryninja.load) for full details

And then go crazy!

```python
>>> bn.core_version()
'4.2.5975-dev Personal'

>>> bv.file
<FileMetadata: Y:/IDBs/windows/kernel32/10.0.18362.329/kernel32.bndb>

>>> bv.arch
<arch: x86_64>

>>> assert bn.binaryview.BinaryView.new(pathlib.Path("c:/temp/chall").read_bytes()).read(0, 4) == b'\x7fELF'

>>> bv.endianness.name
'LittleEndian'

>>> hex(bv.entry_function.start)
'0x1c0272010'

>>> bv.file.original_filename
'Y:/IDBs/windows/kernel32/10.0.18362.329/kernel32.dll'

>>> bv.get_functions_by_name("CreateFileMappingW")
[<func: x86_64@0x18001c250>]

>>> for f in bv.functions:
    print(f"{f.name} -> {f.start:#x}")
RtlVirtualUnwindStub -> 0x180001010
GetNumberFormatWStub -> 0x180001060
GetTimeZoneInformationForYearStub -> 0x180001070
IdnToAsciiStub -> 0x180001080
CreateWaitableTimerW -> 0x180001090
[...]

>>> for block in bv.get_functions_by_name("GlobalUnlock")[0]:
      for insn in block:
        print(insn)
(['mov', '     ', 'qword ', '[', 'rsp', '+', '0x8', ']', ', ', 'rbx'], 5)
(['mov', '     ', 'qword ', '[', 'rsp', '+', '0x10', ']', ', ', 'rsi'], 5)
(['push', '    ', 'rdi'], 1)
[...]
```
